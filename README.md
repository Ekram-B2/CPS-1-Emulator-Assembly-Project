# CPS-1-Emulator-Assembly-Project


The CPS-1 computer was designed by MIL (Microsystems International Limited) in the 1970's. As per the directive of Prof. Zbigniew Stachniak (York University)

The source here is representative of two assembly code programs that were written on top of the CPS-1 Microcontroller which would have implemented a primitive shooter and the classic 'Bagles' game. All code was tested and run on top of a graphical emulator of the CPS-1 computer which was written in C. A point was made that the behaviours of the virtual CPS-1 emulator be as close to the physical device as possible.  

This was a my first passion project as well as the first time I developed software in an assembly language. 

For further inquires on the actual emulator itself - direct emails to museum@cse.yorku.ca for more information.
